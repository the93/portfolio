<h2>Artist and Designer Statement</h2>
  <span><p>Art and design are always combined together as a whole. I create a unity between the two by developing my artistic and design skills simultaneously. As a learning artist, I focus more of the self-expression through different medium of arts. As a learning designer, I focus more of the objectivity and purpose of the design. I create more effective and communicative art and design works by researching thoroughly on my subject areas. The thought process behind each piece is more important to me, and I tend to reveal my thought process and messages implicitly. Additionally, my works are much influenced by eastern and western culture, since I was born and raised in China and moved to the States when I was sixteen. Theoretically and aesthetically my works lean more towards the western art. Yet there are usually some hints of eastern influences that intertwined with my western styles.
